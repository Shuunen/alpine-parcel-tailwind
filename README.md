## Why

I made this to see what happen when mixing these 3 ingredients into one.

Also it can be useful to those who wants to quick-start a project with these fellas, or just have a peek at config files :)

## So

After few months of using Parcel & Tailwind across various personal & professional projects :

- Parcel : I'm not super fan, it has been really time consuming to dive in when build issues appeared, not a "zero-config bundler" or a good option for large projects IMHO, I'll go with **Rollup** now
- Tailwind : **I really enjoyed using Tailwind** and it's now following me for the future projects
- Alpine : I need more experience to have an opinion on it

## RIP

Because I did not fall in love with Parcel, even lost time on it, this project will be archived.
